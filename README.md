## 📫 Card Game information

Object of the Game
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

Card Values/scoring
It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.

The Play
The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). 
Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). 
In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects the bet wagered. The dealer then turns to the next player to their left and serves them in the same manner.
